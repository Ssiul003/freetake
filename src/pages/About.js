            We're a group of college students who love food - not just eating it, but sharing its power to bring people together.
            With rising inflation and the increasing cost of living, we've seen more people struggling to afford basic meals.
            At the same time, so much good food goes to waste daily. That's why we created this platform - a completely free,
            community-driven solution where anyone can donate or claim food effortlessly.

            This wouldn't be possible without the generosity of local businesses and individuals who believe in our mission. Their
            willingness to donate surplus food and support this initiative has helped turn our vision into reality. Unlike other platforms
            that offer discounted meals, our website is 100% free - no hidden costs, no payments. We designed it to be as simple as ordering
            takeout, with an Uber Eats-style experience that makes food donations quick and accessible.

            Together, we're building a community where no food goes to waste, and no one has to go hungry.
